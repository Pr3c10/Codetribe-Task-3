        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I'm Precious Mohale and I am very passionate and creative when it comes to the IT Field and I have one year of working experience.  I've had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects, ranging from troubleshooting software and hardware issues, working with PCs, laptops, Liva's, switches, projector's and input and output devices. My approach to the IT Field is characterized by a blend of innovation and attention to detail, ensuring that each project I undertake is not only visually striking but also functional and user-friendly. I thrive in collaborative environments and am always eager to learn and adapt to new technologies and techniques. When I'm not designing, you can find me reading novels, listening to music, going to see new places and explore the world, singing and spending time with family.</p>
